The front-end pages are created using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The backend framework is ```Python Flask```. The website adopts a ```front-end and back-end separation design```. Based on the Request sent by the front-end, data in ```JSON format``` is returned through the ```RESTful API```.

Version control is managed using ```Git/GitHub```. After completing periodic missions, a Pull Request is sent to the Reviewer. Once approved, the develop branch is merged into the main branch, and the code is synchronized to ```AWS EC2``` to update the website.

## Database
